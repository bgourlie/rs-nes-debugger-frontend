{-| Web sockets make it cheaper to talk to your servers.

Connecting to a server takes some time, so with web sockets, you make that
connection once and then keep using. The major benefits of this are:

1.  It faster to send messages. No need to do a bunch of work for every single
    message.

2.  The server can push messages to you. With normal HTTP you would have to
    keep _asking_ for changes, but a web socket, the server can talk to you
    whenever it wants. This means there is less unnecessary network traffic.

The API here attempts to cover the typical usage scenarios, but if you need
many unique connections to the same endpoint, you need a different library.

-- COMMANDS


type MyCmd msg
    = Send String String


{-| Send a message to a particular address. You might say something like this:

    send "ws://echo.websocket.org" "Hello!"

**Note:** It is important that you are also subscribed to this address with
`listen`. If you are not, the web socket will be created to send one message
and then closed. Not good!

-- SUBSCRIPTIONS


type MySub msg
    = MySub String String (String -> msg)


{-| Subscribe to any incoming messages on a websocket. You might say something
like this:

    type Msg = Echo String | ...

    subscriptions model =
      listen "ws://echo.websocket.org" Echo

**Note:** If the connection goes down, the effect manager tries to reconnect
with an exponential backoff strategy.

{-| Subscribe to websocket open events. You might say something
like this:

    subscriptions model =
      onOpen WsOpened

-}

onOpen tagger =
    subscription (MySub "onOpen" "" tagger)


{-| Subscribe to websocket close events. You might say something
like this:

    type Msg = WsClosed String | ...

    subscriptions model =
      onClose WsClosed

-}
